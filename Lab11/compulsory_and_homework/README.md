## Compulsory (1p)

✅ Use Micrometer and Spring Boot Actuator in order to expose application metrics.  
✅ Create a counter that will measure how many times the StableMatch algorithm is invoked.  
✅ Create a timer that will measure the response time of the StableMatch algorithm.  
✅ Use SLF4J to log exceptions and informative messages.  

---

## Homework (2p)

✅ Install Prometheus and Grafana.  
✅ Collect the response times of the algorithm with Prometheus, and visualize the data in Grafana.  
✅ Set up alerts in Grafana when memory usage exceeds a threshold.  
✅ Use service discovery in order to allow PrefSchedule to find and invoke StableMatch microservice.  
✅ Create multiple instances of the StableMatch microservice and implement an API Gateway with load balancing.
