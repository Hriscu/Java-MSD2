Homework (2p)

✅ Create two simple HTML pages in the application, page1.html and page2.html.  
✅ The application will have a dynamically generated welcome page, containing a form that lets the user select either the value 1 or 2.  
✅ The input will be submitted to a controller servlet that will forward the request either to page1 or page2, depending on the selected value.  
✅ Write in the server log the following information about each request: the HTTP method used, the IP-address of the client, the user-agent, the client language(s) and the parameter of the request.  
✅ Invoke the servlet from a desktop application (Java, Python, .NET, etc.).  
✅ The response of the servlet will be, in this case, a plain text containing the value of the parameter, and not the content of a page.
