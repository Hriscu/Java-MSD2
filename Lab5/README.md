✅ Create at least one custom runtime exception and handle it either at controller level, or globally.  
✅ Implement conditional requests using ETag and support If-None-Match.  
✅ Support content negotiation for JSON and XML for at least one resource.  
✅ Document at least one endpoint with Springdoc OpenAPI and test your services through Swagger UI.
